  <div id="paragraphs">
    <p>Right now, there are about 300 million dogs who are "homeless." These dogs are considered filth to many and thus will not receive any care. These dogs are found in human communities where they are scavenging for food and sheltering wherever they can. Most of them have conditions that are actually very disfiguring and painful. They may also carry parasites like tapeworms and hookworms and ailments like scabies and rabies. These dogs don't deserve this, but this is just the reality of the environment they grew up in. Support Global Dog as they aim to reduce the populations of homeless dogs and encourage greater care for these dogs globally. They launch campaigns in Latin America as well as Africa and Asia to eliminate rabies. The humane and effective management of these dogs can have unforeseen benefits in the communities, including but not limited to dog diseases that can be spread to humans and dog nuisance.
